#   Automated Spectrophotometer (Team Work)

I'm excited to share my latest projectâ€”an **Automated Spectrophotometer** that brings precision and automation to sample analysis.

##  Project Highlights:
- **10-Sample Disk**: Our spectrophotometer features a disk holding 10 samples, which is rotated by a stepper motor for sequential analysis.
- **Precision Measurement**: We measure the concentration of liquid samples by analyzing the transmitted light, ensuring accurate results.
- **IR Remote Control**: The entire system is controlled via an IR remote, offering convenience and ease of use.
- **Automated Data Handling**: The results, including sample number and concentration, are automatically saved to an Excel sheet, streamlining data management.
- **Real-Time Display**: Users can view the results directly on an LCD screen, providing immediate feedback.

This project showcases my skills in **automation, electronics, and data processing**, and I'm thrilled with the outcome. It was a great learning experience in combining hardware with software to create an efficient and user-friendly system.
