#  RC-Car Control Project (Team Work )

This project involves controlling motors, LEDs, and a horn using an Arduino and Mobile application. The system can move forward, backward, left, right, and diagonally, and it also includes controls for front and back LEDs, a horn, and a set of yellow LEDs that can blink based on user input.

##  Components:
- Arduino board
- DC motors (2)
- LEDs (for forward, backward, and yellow blinking)
- Horn (buzzer)
- Motor driver (L298N or similar)
- Power supply
- bluetooth module
- Mobile application

##  Functionalities:
1. **Movement**: Control the Car for forward, backward, and directional movements By Mobile application.
2. **LED Controls**: Turn on and off the front and back LEDs.
3. **Horn Control**: Toggle the horn on and off using the serial input.
4. **IR Remote**: Serial communication allows control via an IR remote.
