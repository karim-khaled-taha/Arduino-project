# ðŸš— RC-Car Control Project

This project involves controlling motors, LEDs, and a horn using an Arduino and serial communication. The system can move forward, backward, left, right, and diagonally, and it also includes controls for front and back LEDs, a horn, and a set of yellow LEDs that can blink based on user input.

## ðŸ”§ Components:
- Arduino board
- DC motors (2)
- LEDs (for forward, backward, and yellow blinking)
- Horn (buzzer)
- Motor driver (L298N or similar)
- Power supply
- IR Remote

## ðŸš€ Functionalities:
1. **Movement**: Control the motors for forward, backward, and directional movements.
2. **LED Controls**: Turn on and off the front and back LEDs.
3. **Yellow LED Blinking**: Blinking yellow lights for indicating a condition.
4. **Horn Control**: Toggle the horn on and off using the serial input.
5. **IR Remote**: Serial communication allows control via an IR remote.
